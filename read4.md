**HTML5**
Is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of
a page.For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure
of the page.
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article> element or not.
The <section> element groups related content together, and
typically each section would have its own heading.
The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.
Examples of usage include:
● Images
● Videos
● Graphs
● Diagrams
● Code samples
● Text that supports the main
body of an article
